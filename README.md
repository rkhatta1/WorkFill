## WorkFill - Automated account creation for workday jobs.

A simple browser extension that stores your default credentials and fills them accordingly on workdayjobs sites (for now) with the click of a button.

### Why not just copy-paste?
Copying and pasting is what I resorted to in the past. One major flaw with copy pasting is that you cannot copy and paste in most "Verify X" form fields.

Previously, it took me anywhere from 10-20 seconds per sign up page to fill in all the credentials. This extension reduces that time to less than a second.

It is not a lot in isolation, but when you consider an average of 30 applications a day, it could save upwards of 10 minutes of your time. In other words it is more than 20x faster than copy-pasting/manual methods.
